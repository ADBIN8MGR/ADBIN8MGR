# Hi there, I'm Adbin Magar. 👋

I'm a cybersecurity student and aspiring Security Researcher, operating under the brand **[The Grey Lens](https://thegreylens.hashnode.dev/)**. I'm passionate about deconstructing systems to understand how they work and how they break.

- 🔭 I’m currently diving deep into network penetration testing and Linux privilege escalation techniques.
- 🌱 I’m learning to apply my skills in practical labs like the Kioptrix series and documenting my journey.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on CTF challenges and open-source security projects.
- 🤔 My main interest lies in OSINT and the reconnaissance phase of ethical hacking.
